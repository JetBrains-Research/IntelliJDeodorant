An IntelliJ IDEA plugin that detects code smells and recommends appropriate refactorings to resolve them. 

Based on [JDeodorant](https://github.com/tsantalis/JDeodorant) Eclipse plugin.

The original tool supports five code smells, namely **Feature Envy**, **Type/State Checking**, **Long Method**, **God Class** and **Duplicated Code**. 

*Work in progress. The check mark indicates that the code smell is supported by IntelliJDeodorant.*

- [x] Feature Envy problems can be resolved by appropriate Move Method refactorings.
- [ ] Type Checking problems can be resolved by appropriate Replace Conditional with Polymorphism refactorings.
- [ ] State Checking problems can be resolved by appropriate Replace Type code with State/Strategy refactorings.
- [x] Long Method problems can be resolved by appropriate Extract Method refactorings.
- [ ] God Class problems can be resolved by appropriate Extract Class refactorings.
- [ ] Duplicated Code problems can be resolved by appropriate Extract Clone refactorings.
